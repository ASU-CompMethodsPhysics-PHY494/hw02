# PHY 494: Homework assignment 2

* Due Tuesday 1/26 midnight.

* Follow the link in Canvas to set up your HW2 repository.

* `git clone` your repository to your laptop.

* Read the instructions ([assignment_02.md](assignment_02.md)) in your text editor or through GitHub.

* Work through the problem, check in your changes into your repository
  (`git add`, `git commit`), and `git push` your changes to the remote
  repository on GitHub.

**Tests and Autograding**: You can check that your answer is correct
by running the following command from the top of your working
directory:

     pytest

These tests are also ran automatically as soon as you push changes to
GitHub. Open "pull request 1" (the Feedback pull request) in your
repository on GitHub to see results.


## 2.1 Copy, rename, delete (10 points)

Work through the [Copy, rename, delete:
Activity](https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/2021/01/14/01_Unix_Shell/#activity-homework).

After you completed the activity (points 1 – 11) you should end up
with a specific directory structure under `~/PHY494/01_shell`.



Note that this exercise builds on previous parts of [01 The Unix
Shell](https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/2021/01/14/01_Unix_Shell/),
which you should have also done).


## 2.2 (OPTIONAL) "In the beginning was the command line"

(Skim)read Neal Stephenson’s **In the Beginning was the command line**
from 1999
([PDF](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/file_download/7/NealStephenson_Commandline.pdf?mimetype=pdf)). What
are the advantages and disadvantages of using the command line instead
of a graphical user interface?
